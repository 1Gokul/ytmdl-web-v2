### What is Ytmdl?

Ytmdl started as a CLI project as can be seen [here](https://github.com/deepjyoti30/ytmdl). The CLI version is still in active development, however a lot of people were complaining that the CLI version doesn't support Windows. I gave it some thought and at the time I was also learning VueJS and fancied building a proper WebApp so I ended up building this, the Web version of Ytmdl.

### What does it do?

It is basically an app that addresses a major problem that people face, getting high quality songs from already available sources. I used to download songs a lot from YouTube using tools like `youtube-dl` but all these tools do is download the audio and thats it, no metadata. It was creating a mess of songs in my library, so I decided to build this tool. It gets the audio from YouTube using tools like `youtube-dl` in the backend and processes the songs and adds high quality metadata to them.

### How can I support the project?

You can always support the project by donating to me directly through [Paypal](https://paypal.me/deepjyoti30).

You can also check the repo which is open source [here](https://github.com/deepjyoti30/ytmdl).

### Who are you?

You can check my personal page [here](https://deepjyoti30.dev). I love using and customizing Linux. I'll be honest, Linux is how I ended up building the CLI version of `ytmdl` and now this web version. Oh, BTW, I use Arch :-p.
